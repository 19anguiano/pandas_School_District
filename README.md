# pandas_School_District

# Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Summaries
I've compiled the following four summaries: district, school, highest and lowest performing schools (by % overall passing). 

## District Summary

# Scores
I've organized scores from each school into various categories: math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.

## Math Scores by Grade

## Reading Scores by Grade

## Scores by School Spending

## Scores by School Size

## Scores by School Type

# Conclusions
The data shows students' scores are influenced by school spending, size, and type. Students are more likely to pass if the student budget is $630 or less, according to the chart depicting scores by school spending. When looking at school sizes, small and medium schools have a higher overall passing percentage. Lastly, charter schools have a higher overall passing percentage. Charter schools have less students and overall spending, but yet yield successful results. Future school budgets and priorities should mimic the current charter school model.
